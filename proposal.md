# CSP
CSP is a program that allows IB students to organize their school work systematically.
It would include a *Calendar*, *Assessment Database*, *Project Manager*, and a *Todolist*.

All of the data created would be stored in a database file.
In order to sync the database across many devices, the user would only have to sync the database file.

## Calendar --- Jerry
The calendar contains information about the upcoming classes.
The calendar should automatically generate the schedule based on a provided cycle, and have self correcting features to manually set the current class of the day.

## Assessment Database --- Uzen
The Assessment Database shows information about the upcoming assessments.
The assessments would be scraped from the ManageBac Dashboard iCal file.

## Todolist --- Cobbi
The todolist contains the non academic related tasks of a student.
It should store the data based on the "todo.txt" format.

## Project Manager
The Project Manager allows the user to categorize their homework/assessments to classes.
The program would allow students to dedicate a specific amount of time to each task, when to do it, and store information on the completion rate.
It would also provide a feature that allows the student to "do" their task;
taking down a time stamp of when they started and when they ended.
